Writing code is an art. Sometimes you're inspired, sometimes you stare at a semicolon for thirty minutes. But each new project makes you better.

That's why daily practice matters. It doesn't have to be long â€” consistency is more important than intensity.

Python is a great language for beginners. It's readable, powerful, and widely used in the industry. You'll find it in data analysis, web development, automation, and even game design.

Git helps you track changes in your code. GitHub makes it collaborative. Don't forget to commit your work daily.

Good luck on your journey to becoming a developer!
